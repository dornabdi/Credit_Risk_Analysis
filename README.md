# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this project. I applied machine learning to evaluate credit card risk. However, Credit card risk is unbalanced. Therefore, I used six different techniques to train and evaluate models using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries. 

I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids aalgorithm. I then combined over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Then I compared these two to the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
